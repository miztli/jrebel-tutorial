## JRebel gradle plugin setup

- When using Gradle 2.1 or newer, add the following snippet to the top of your `build.gradle` script:

```
plugins {
   id "org.zeroturnaround.gradle.jrebel" version "1.1.9"
}
```

- The plugin provides a new task called generateRebel that by default depends on the processResources phase. For more fine-tuned control it can be changed to only run before certain tasks, for example only before building a war artifact:

```
war.dependsOn(generateRebel)
```

- In most cases, this is all you need to do. The plugin should be able to read the locations of your classes and resources from Gradleâ€™s project model and put them into your `rebel.xml`

- List tasks: `./gradlew tasks --all`. Look for `generateRebel` task.

- Run: `./gradlew build` or `./gradlew generateRebel` and look for generated file into: `{projectPath}/build/jrebel/rebel.xml`
